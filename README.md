# Tutorial about php oop (NOT CODING) what are childs, parents, constructors, private, static & public static functions and with easy to understand examples in a way that even an aussie can understand it

----------------------------------------------------

Sure, here is a full-on tutorial about PHP OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) with easy-to-understand examples, tailored for our Aussie mate:

**Oi, oi, oi! Let's dive into PHP OOP, drongo**

Imagine you're a true blue Aussie bloke, standing in the middle of the outback. You're surrounded by kangaroos, wallabies, and emus. How would you organize those creatures in a way that makes sense, mate?

That's where PHP OOP comes in, ya drongo. It's like wrangling a mob of kangaroos – you gotta have a system, mate.

**Classes: The Blueprints for Your Creatures**

Think of a class as a blueprint for a creature. It describes what makes each creature unique, like its name, type (kangaroo, wallaby, emu), and behavior (hopping, jumping, flying).

For example, you could create a class called *Kangaroo* with fields like *name*, *type*, and *legs*. You could then create objects of the *Kangaroo* class, like *Roger*, *Skippy*, and *Joey*, and give each one its own name and number of legs.

**Objects: The Creatures Themselves**

Objects are like the actual creatures roaming the outback. They're instances of a class, meaning they have the characteristics and behaviors defined in that class.

For instance, *Roger* and *Skippy* are both objects of the *Kangaroo* class. They have the same fields (*name*, *type*, *legs*) and behaviors (hopping).

**Inheritance: Passing Down the Family Tree**

Imagine a kangaroo and a wallaby. They're both marsupials, right? So, they share some similarities.

Inheritance allows classes to inherit fields and methods from other classes. For example, you could create a *Marsupial* class that defines common fields like *pouch* and *diet*, and then both *Kangaroo* and *Wallaby* classes could inherit from *Marsupial*. This way, they'd have all the marsupial traits, plus their unique kangaroo or wallaby characteristics.

**Polymorphism: Shapeshifting Creatures**

Polymorphism means that different objects can respond to the same method call in different ways. Imagine you tell a kangaroo and an emu to "hop". The kangaroo will hop, but the emu will run.

Polymorphism allows objects to have their own version of a method, even though the method name is the same. This makes code more flexible and dynamic.

**Encapsulation: Keeping Secrets in the Outback**

Encapsulation means controlling who has access to an object's fields and methods. Imagine you have a kangaroo's pouch filled with joeys. You don't want just anyone poking around in there, mate!

Encapsulation allows you to make certain fields and methods private, meaning they can only be accessed within the object itself or by specific other objects. This protects data integrity and prevents unauthorized changes.

**Abstraction: Focusing on the Essentials**

Abstraction means hiding unnecessary details and focusing on essential features and behaviors. Imagine you're observing a kangaroo hopping. You don't need to know the exact muscle movements and nerve impulses – just that it's hopping.

Abstraction allows you to create simpler, more reusable code by hiding irrelevant details and focusing on the core functionality.

**Constructors: Building Your Creatures**

Constructors are like the blueprints for building your creatures. They're special methods that are automatically called when an object is created, allowing you to initialize the object's fields and perform any necessary setup operations.

For example, you could create a constructor for the *Kangaroo* class that takes a name and number of legs as parameters, and it would use those parameters to initialize the *name* and *legs* fields of the kangaroo object.

**Parents and Child Classes: Family Ties**

In inheritance, a child class inherits fields and methods from its parent class. It's like a family tree – the child inherits traits from its parents.

For instance, the *Kangaroo* class could be a child class of the *Marsupial* class. This means *Kangaroo* inherits all the fields and methods of *Marsupial*, plus any additional fields and methods specific to *Kangaroo*.

**Private, Public, Static, and Instance Methods: Access Control**

Methods are like the actions your creatures can perform, like hopping, jumping, or flying. There are different types of methods based on their accessibility and how they're called:

    Private methods: Only accessible within the object itself, like a kangaroo keeping its joeys safe in its pouch.

    Public methods: Accessible from outside the object, allowing other objects to interact with it, like a wallaby approaching a kangaroo for a chat.

    Static methods: Associated with the class itself, not with
