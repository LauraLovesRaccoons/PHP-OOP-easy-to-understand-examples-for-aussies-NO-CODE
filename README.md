# mate write me A full on tutorial about php oop (NOT CODING) what are childs parents constructors private static, public static functions and shit mate with easy to understand examples because i'm aussie and shit       and speak strayan mate

----------------------------------------------------

Sure, here is a full-on tutorial about PHP OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) with easy-to-understand examples, tailored for our Aussie mate:

Oi, oi, oi! Let's dive into PHP OOP, drongo

Imagine you're a true blue Aussie bloke, standing in the middle of the outback. You're surrounded by kangaroos, wallabies, and emus. How would you organize those creatures in a way that makes sense, mate?

That's where PHP OOP comes in, ya drongo. It's like wrangling a mob of kangaroos – you gotta have a system, mate.

Classes: The Blueprints for Your Creatures

Think of a class as a blueprint for a creature. It describes what makes each creature unique, like its name, type (kangaroo, wallaby, emu), and behavior (hopping, jumping, flying).

For example, you could create a class called Kangaroo with fields like name, type, and legs. You could then create objects of the Kangaroo class, like Roger, Skippy, and Joey, and give each one its own name and number of legs.

Objects: The Creatures Themselves

Objects are like the actual creatures roaming the outback. They're instances of a class, meaning they have the characteristics and behaviors defined in that class.

For instance, Roger and Skippy are both objects of the Kangaroo class. They have the same fields (name, type, legs) and behaviors (hopping).

Inheritance: Passing Down the Family Tree

Imagine a kangaroo and a wallaby. They're both marsupials, right? So, they share some similarities.

Inheritance allows classes to inherit fields and methods from other classes. For example, you could create a Marsupial class that defines common fields like pouch and diet, and then both Kangaroo and Wallaby classes could inherit from Marsupial. This way, they'd have all the marsupial traits, plus their unique kangaroo or wallaby characteristics.

Polymorphism: Shapeshifting Creatures

Polymorphism means that different objects can respond to the same method call in different ways. Imagine you tell a kangaroo and an emu to "hop". The kangaroo will hop, but the emu will run.

Polymorphism allows objects to have their own version of a method, even though the method name is the same. This makes code more flexible and dynamic.

Encapsulation: Keeping Secrets in the Outback

Encapsulation means controlling who has access to an object's fields and methods. Imagine you have a kangaroo's pouch filled with joeys. You don't want just anyone poking around in there, mate!

Encapsulation allows you to make certain fields and methods private, meaning they can only be accessed within the object itself or by specific other objects. This protects data integrity and prevents unauthorized changes.

Abstraction: Focusing on the Essentials

Abstraction means hiding unnecessary details and focusing on essential features and behaviors. Imagine you're observing a kangaroo hopping. You don't need to know the exact muscle movements and nerve impulses – just that it's hopping.

Abstraction allows you to create simpler, more reusable code by hiding irrelevant details and focusing on the core functionality.

Constructors: Building Your Creatures

Constructors are like the blueprints for building your creatures. They're special methods that are automatically called when an object is created, allowing you to initialize the object's fields and perform any necessary setup operations.

For example, you could create a constructor for the Kangaroo class that takes a name and number of legs as parameters, and it would use those parameters to initialize the name and legs fields of the kangaroo object.

Parents and Child Classes: Family Ties

In inheritance, a child class inherits fields and methods from its parent class. It's like a family tree – the child inherits traits from its parents.

For instance, the Kangaroo class could be a child class of the Marsupial class. This means Kangaroo inherits all the fields and methods of Marsupial, plus any additional fields and methods specific to Kangaroo.

Private, Public, Static, and Instance Methods: Access Control

Methods are like the actions your creatures can perform, like hopping, jumping, or flying. There are different types of methods based on their accessibility and how they're called:

    Private methods: Only accessible within the object itself, like a kangaroo keeping its joeys safe in its pouch.

    Public methods: Accessible from outside the object, allowing other objects to interact with it, like a wallaby approaching a kangaroo for a chat.

    Static methods: Associated with the class itself, not with
